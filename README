This is a skeleton for julia based projects. It sets up per-project package dependency tracking similar to virtualenv.

To use the skeleton to start a project you can do:
git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:clwyatt/julia_project_skeleton mynewprojectdir
rm -rf mynewprojectdir/.git

Run julia with JULIA_PKGDIR=mynewprojectdir/packages julia

The packages directory contains a subdir with a semantic version e.g. v0.3 with a REQUIRE file in it listing the packages

The included .gitignore is setup track REQUIRE but ignore everything else in that directory.

The setup script (setup.jl) simply does 
Pkg.init()
Pkg.update()
to pull the right versions and build them where julia expects. This can be rerun using 
JULIA_PKGDIR=mynewprojectdir/packages julia setup.jl
